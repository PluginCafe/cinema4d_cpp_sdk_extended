/*
This is an example of a brush that is similar to the main Sculpting Grab Brush in Cinema4D.
This brush type uses the brush mode SCULPTBRUSHMODE::GRAB. When using this mode
it will select any points under the dab and keep them selected throughout the entire
brush stroke. This is different from the other brush mode where the points for each dab
are updated every time the mouse moves. This allows you to create brushes like the grab brush
where you are just moving those points around until the user lets go of them.
